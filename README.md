## Prefab
Revert - Effectively the same as going through each prefab individually and clicking "revert."

## Select
None - Select nothing. Good for when you have nowhere to click but don't want anything selected.
Parent - Select the parents of your currently selected objects.
Children (All) - Select children recursively to your current selected objects.
Children (Next) - Select children non-recursively to your current selected objects.

## Sort
Alphabetically - Re-order the transform order with alphabetical sorting by name.
Invert - Invert the transform order.

## Group
Group - Create a new object using the input field as a name and parent selected objects to it. The position is set to the center of all selected transforms.
